Drag &amp; drop your Sib trumpet MusicXML file to get a commented music sheet with valve fingerings!

### How to use

Install the `.dmg` file and drag & drop your sheet file in the box.
Ensure that you have it in MusicXML format: `.mxl`. If your file is another format like `.mscz`, `.mscx` or else, open it with MuseScore and export it to `.mxl` format. Otherwise there are online converters that would do it for you easily.
